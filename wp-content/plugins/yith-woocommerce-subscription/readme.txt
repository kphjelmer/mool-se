It allows you to manage recurring payments for product subscription that grant you constant periodical income

== Description ==

YITH WooCommerce Subscription is the complete solution to **sell products or services with a subscription plan** in your e-commerce, manage recurring payments and loyalize your customers.

Selling products on a subscription basis lets you get regular payments and monitor your income growth month by month.

This has become the most popular business model in recent years: users pay for a subscription – typically weekly, monthly, or annually – to use software, to access training courses, to read a magazine, to get unlimited access to an archive of useful resources (like the audio file library offered by Amazon Audible or sites with photos stocks) or to benefit from a hosting service. But this applies also to gyms, video games, libraries, consulting or coaching services, legal advisory, etc… It’s a winning business model that suits most of the products or services available for sale.

With this plugin you can easily create **subscription products and get recurring payments** in your WooCommerce shops.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Is it compatible with all WordPress themes? =

Compatibility with all themes is impossible, because they are too many, but generally if themes are developed according to WordPress and WooCommerce guidelines, YITH plugins are compatible with them.
Yet, we can grant compatibility with themes developed by YITH, because they are constantly updated and tested with our plugins. Sometimes, especially when new versions are released, it might only require some time for them to be all updated, but you can be sure that they will be tested and will be working in a few days.
